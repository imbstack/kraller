Kraller
======

A little application to allow signups with keys for accounts on the cwru acm server.

Installation
------------
`pip install -e .` from the top level of the project that contains setup.py

kraller ALL=(root)NOPASSWD:/usr/local/sbin/kraller_adduser,/usr/sbin/usermod
kraller ALL=(%users)NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/add_ssh_key

Running
-------
Call the kraller/kraller.py directly during development.  Set it up on Gunicorn 
or something similar in production.

KRALLER_SETTINGS must be set in the shell and point to a file containing 
CAS_SERVER_ENDPOINT = '<endpoint>' where <endpoint> is something along the lines
of https://login.case.edu/cas/.  In addition, it should contain a SECRET_KEY for 
use by the session.  DO NOT LET ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT SECRET IS.  Finally, it 
should have a BLACKLIST_FILE field giving the full path to a file containing a 
list of blacklisted users.  That list should have one user per line, where a user
is a caseid _without_ @case.edu.


There is an example config file called config.py.example in the kraller directory.
